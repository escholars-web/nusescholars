I'm currently studying Financial Engineering at the Risk Management Institute.\n\nI like learning and took as many interesting as courses I could handle, including convex optimisation, business law, and business econometrics. Beyond that, I've also completed the Associate Data Scientist in Python pathway on DataCamp and the Foundations in AI course by AISG.\n\nMy internship and final year project has let me explore some of the areas where Life Science and Engineering intersect, two of the things that have fascinated me for a long time.\n\nOutside of academics, I love hiking and travelling, gymnastics/calisthenics, and rock climbing/bouldering. Some mountains I've summmitted include Scout Peak (5710m) in the Himalayas, Mytikas Peak of Mount Olympus (2918m), and Mount Rinjani in Lombok (3726m).\n\nHowever, my personal mountain to climb is finding in a career that gives me such a strong sense of purpose that I would want to continue in it even when I feel secure in my finances.",

I‚Äôm very interested in the bonding and welfare committee because I really want E-scholars to have more opportunities to bond with one another on a regular basis!! This builds a support system that E-scholars can rely on, especially since we are all majoring in engineering, and so we can relate with one another better and understand each other‚Äôs stress and concerns( for eg on a common engineering course). Being more familiar with one another also prevents E-scholars from feeling paiseh in seeking help from other E-scholars. üòÇ Also, I understand that most E-scholars stay in RC4. For me, I stay in nusc but the friends I have made from the E-scholars orientation stay in RC4 so I‚Äôm really sad that there‚Äôs little opportunities for me to interact with them :(( Hence, I really want to join the welfare committee to help organise bonding events so that E-scholars can have many opportunities to bond with one another!! :))) Apart from this reason, I also want to be involved in preparing welfare packs so that I can help E-scholars feel less stressed and more encouraged during exam period. All in all, the first few friends I have made in NUS are from the community of E-scholars so I really feel strongly for giving back and contributing to the welfare of E-scholars. :))",
